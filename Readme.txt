The MATLAB file Amplitude_Modulation_and_Demodulation(.m) contains the code for amplitude modulation and demodulation.

To find the desired result run the code.

Enter the frequency and amplitude of the message signal, the frequency of the carrier wave and the phase difference between the carrier wave and the message signal after running the code.

Output obtained contains a compilation of five graphs, that include the signal wave, carrier wave, modulated signal wave, demodulated signal wave, filtered demodulated signal wave, all plotted against time respectively.
